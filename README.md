#3D printed recording chamber for mouse neurophysiology

These are 3D CAD drawings for a mouse-sized plastic chamber and cap that can be 3D printed very cheaply and chronically implanted over a craniotomy to keep the dural surface clean and healthy. The approximate inside diameter of the chamber is 3.5 mm.

Note that for the best results it helps to add a very small drop of Kwik Sil or other silicone elastomer to the dura surface before securing the cap. If this is done the dura will stay healthy for weeks to months.
